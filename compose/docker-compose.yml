  Create a service called "frontend" that is responsible for configs:
  building and starting container running the react app.

  Hints:
    1. look inside the frontend directory!
    2. you can start a react app with the command: npm start
    3. we want requests on OUR port 3000 to go get mapped INTO the
      CONTAINER's port 3000 .
    4. Make sure your indentation matches the indentation of the other services!
